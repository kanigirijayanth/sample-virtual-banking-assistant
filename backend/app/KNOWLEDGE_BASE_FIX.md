# Knowledge Base Integration Fix

## Issue
The virtual banking assistant was unable to fetch details from the Bedrock Knowledge base. The error was:
```
Error initializing Nova Lite service: name 'os' is not defined
```

## Root Cause
The `os` module was imported in the wrong order in the `aws.py` file. The module was imported after it was used, causing the error.

## Solution
1. Added the `os` import at the beginning of the `aws.py` file:
```python
import os
import asyncio
import base64
import json
import time
import uuid
import wave
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum
from importlib.resources import files
from typing import Any, List, Optional
```

2. Updated the `kb_integration.py` file to use a hardcoded knowledge base ID:
```python
def __init__(self, kb_id="KCZTEHHZFA", region="us-east-1", max_results=3):
    """
    Initialize the knowledge base enhancer.
    
    Args:
        kb_id (str): Knowledge base ID
        region (str): AWS region
        max_results (int): Maximum number of results to retrieve from the knowledge base
    """
    # Use specific knowledge base ID
    self.kb_id = kb_id
    # Create the retrieval function
    self.retrieve_from_kb = create_kb_retrieval_function(self.kb_id, region)
    
    self.max_results = max_results
```

3. Updated the `main.py` file to use the hardcoded knowledge base ID:
```python
# Initialize knowledge base enhancer with hardcoded KB ID
kb_enhancer = KnowledgeBaseEnhancer(kb_id="KCZTEHHZFA")
```

## Verification
The knowledge base integration was tested and confirmed to be working correctly:
```
Querying knowledge base KCZTEHHZFA with: What are the AWS account policies?
Knowledge base response received. Results: 3
Results found: 3
```

## Additional Notes
- The application is running and responding to health checks.
- The knowledge base integration is working correctly with the application.
- The changes were made directly on the running container to avoid having to redeploy the application.
- The local files were updated to match the changes made on the container.
